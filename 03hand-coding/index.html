     <h1>My Artistic Background</h1>
     <h2>For how long?</h2>
     <li> <strong>Ever since I can remember</strong>, drawing has been a part of my life. It all started in <em>kindergarten</em>, when I first realized that I wanted a career in art. The moment I picked up a crayon and began sketching, I felt a spark—a deep connection to creating something from nothing. That feeling of expressing myself through art stuck with me and has never left. Over the years, I've honed my skills, and after 14 years of drawing, I can confidently say that being an artist isn't just something I do; it's who I am. My journey began as a child and continues to shape my life, as I've always known that this is the path I'm meant to follow.</p>
     <li>I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of artistic mediums over time. From the tactile experience of painting and sculpting to expressing myself through movement in dance, I've always enjoyed experimenting with different forms of art. Playing the flute has also been a deeply rewarding outlet for me, allowing me to explore music in a personal way. On top of that, photography has given me a chance to capture the beauty of the world around me, each image telling its own story. All of these artistic endeavors have allowed me to discover new ways to express my creativity and connect with the world. Each medium has deepened my appreciation for art, offering unique perspectives and ways to communicate what words sometimes cannot convey.</p>

     <h2>My upbringing</h2>
     <li>I was born in the vibrant heart of Mexico City, but my family made the journey to Utah when I was just 10 months old. Growing up, I was immersed in two distinct cultures—the rich traditions of my Mexican heritage and the new surroundings of life in Utah. This duality has profoundly shaped my identity, giving me a deep appreciation for the beauty of both worlds. It's a unique blend that has taught me resilience, empathy, and pride in who I am, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p>

     <h2>Mediums that I prefer to work with</h2>
     <ol>
        <h3>Ink and Paper</h3>
         <ul>
         <li>Working with pen and ink has always been a special passion of mine. There’s something so satisfying about creating different brushstrokes, each one carrying its own energy and character. The feeling of buying a fresh sketchbook fills me with excitement, a blank canvas ready for new ideas and experiments. I love the permanence of the medium—the fact that mistakes can't be erased makes every mark intentional, even when things don't go as planned. It’s a freeing way to create, where every imperfection becomes part of the artwork's story.</li>
             
         <h3>Colored Pencils and Markers</h3>
         <li>I love combining colored pencils and markers in my creative process. I start with markers to lay down a bold, smooth base, and then layer colored pencils over them to add texture and intricate details. Vibrant colors are my go-to, as they bring so much energy and personality to my work. This technique allows me to blend the boldness of markers with the subtlety of pencil strokes, transforming the ideas in my imagination into vivid, tangible pieces of art. It’s a process that feels dynamic and deeply satisfying every time.<li>
         <h3>Digital Art</h3>
         <li>Creating digital art on Procreate and Adobe has become one of my favorite creative outlets. The possibilities feel truly endless in this medium, with countless tools and effects at my fingertips to bring my ideas to life. I also love how accessible it is—I can take my tablet anywhere, making it easy to create while traveling or on the go. Whether experimenting with new techniques or perfecting a piece, digital art offers a freedom and versatility that keeps me inspired.</li>
