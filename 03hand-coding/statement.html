    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<h2>My Favorite Pieces</h2>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>One of my most personal and emotional pieces was created out of a deeply traumatic experience. At the center is a girl in a prison suit, symbolizing how I was judged and perceived by others. She’s in shackles, a representation of the overwhelming betrayal I felt. Behind her, a fire consumes what used to be her home, a visual metaphor for loss and destruction. The narrative in the piece leaves no one else to blame but her, capturing the weight of guilt and responsibility that came after a confession. This artwork is a raw expression of that moment, translating pain into a visual story.</p>

<h3>Generatoinal</h3>
    <p>I created a poster that captures my identity and the influences that have shaped me into someone who deeply cares about social and political issues. The top row features a drawing of myself holding a megaphone, declaring my passion and willingness to speak out. Behind me are representations of Mexico City and Utah, two places that have profoundly influenced my beliefs. Below that is a row of my friends, who have been instrumental in shaping my sense of morality and empathy. The bottom row showcases punk artists I grew up listening to, whose bold discussions of controversial topics inspired me at a young age. Together, these elements represent the people, places, and ideas that have guided me to become who I am today.</p>

<h3>I've Been Shot</h3>
    <p>I created an art piece as a way to process a heartbreaking experience, channeling my emotions into something visual. The piece was built with a marker base and enhanced with colored pencil details. It portrays a jester in a desert-like environment during sunset, inspired by the song "I've Been Shot" by Fletcher Shears. The jester, a representation of myself, sits alone, pondering after receiving a scroll carried by a bird that can be seen flying away in the distance. An arrow pierces the jester’s leg, left untreated, symbolizing my inability to let go of what happened. The lingering arrow represents the last connection I have to someone I’ve lost, making it both painful and precious. This artwork became a powerful outlet for me to confront and explore my emotions.</p>

    <dt>Ian Worthington</dt>
    <dd>Ian Worthington, better known as Worthikids on Instagram and YouTube, is an artist I’ve admired since I discovered his work back in 2018. At the time, he was sharing short animations, and I was instantly captivated by his unique style. His characters are full of life, with expressions that feel so genuine and relatable. Beyond that, he’s a master of many talents, from animation to music, showcasing an impressive versatility. What truly sets him apart is his sense of humor, which shines brilliantly through his creations, making them not only entertaining but also deeply memorable.</dd>
    <dt>Criag McCracken</dt>
    <dd>Craig McCracken is one of my all-time favorite artists. I grew up watching his incredible cartoons, with The Powerpuff Girls, Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends, and Kid Cosmic holding a special place in my heart. Not only do these shows evoke a strong sense of nostalgia, but they’ve also stood the test of time, as I still enjoy them as an adult. His work is a perfect mix of sweetness and depth, with unforgettable characters and stories. I deeply respect him for his talent and creativity as a cartoon maker—his impact on animation is undeniable.</dd>

    <dd>Bluffycr3am’s digital artwork never fails to leave me in awe. Her talent and creativity are at a level I aspire to reach someday. Beyond being an inspiration, I see her as a role model, especially because she’s from Mexico, which gives me an extra sense of connection to her journey. What truly amazes me is her ability to consistently produce such high-quality work at an incredible pace. Her dedication and passion shine through everything she creates, and it’s one of the many reasons I think she’s an amazing person.</dd>
