        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <p>I was born in the vibrant heart of Mexico City, which is located far which is seen as in <a href="https://geology.com/world/mexico-satellite-image.shtml#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mexico's map</a>, although its Americas neighboring country its still pretty far. but my family made the journey to Utah when I was just 10 months old. Growing up, I was immersed in two distinct cultures—the rich traditions of my Mexican heritage and the new surroundings of life in Utah. This duality has profoundly shaped my identity, giving me a deep appreciation for the beauty of both worlds.</p>
        
        <h1>My Artistic Background</h1>

    <h2>Art Mediums</h2>
    <p>These are <strong>Mediums</strong> that I work with when creating my artwork.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paper and ink</li>
        <li>Colored Pencils and Marker</li>
        <li>Digital Art</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Working with pen and ink has always been a special passion of mine. There’s something so satisfying about creating different brushstrokes, each one carrying its own energy and character. The feeling of buying a fresh sketchbook fills me with excitement, a blank canvas ready for new ideas and experiments. I love the <em>permanence</em> of the medium—the fact that mistakes can't be erased makes every mark intentional, even when things don't go as planned. It’s a freeing way to create, where every imperfection becomes part of the artwork's story.</p>
    <p>I love combining colored pencils and markers in my creative process. I start with markers to lay down a bold, smooth base, and then layer colored pencils over them to add texture and intricate details. Vibrant colors are my go-to, as they bring so much energy and personality to my work. This technique allows me to blend the boldness of markers with the subtlety of pencil strokes, transforming the ideas in my imagination into vivid, tangible pieces of art. It’s a process that feels <em>dynamic</em> and deeply satisfying every time.</p>
    <p>Creating digital art on Procreate and Adobe has become one of my favorite creative outlets. The possibilities feel truly <em>endless</em> in this medium, with countless tools and effects at my fingertips to bring my ideas to life. I also love how accessible it is—I can take my tablet anywhere, making it easy to create while traveling or on the go. Whether experimenting with new techniques or perfecting a piece, digital art offers a freedom and versatility that keeps me inspired.

            <dt>Ian Worthington</dt>
            <dd>Ian Worthington, better known as Worthikids on Instagram and YouTube, is an artist I’ve admired since I discovered his work back in 2018. At the time, he was sharing short animations, and I was instantly captivated by his unique style. His characters are full of life, with expressions that feel so genuine and relatable. Beyond that, he’s a master of many talents, from animation to music, showcasing an impressive versatility. What truly sets him apart is his sense of humor, which shines brilliantly through his creations, making them not only entertaining but also deeply memorable.</dd>
            <dt>Criag McCracken</dt>
            <dd>Craig McCracken is one of my all-time favorite artists. I grew up watching his incredible cartoons, with The Powerpuff Girls, Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends, and Kid Cosmic holding a special place in my heart. Not only do these shows evoke a strong sense of nostalgia, but they’ve also stood the test of time, as I still enjoy them as an adult. His work is a perfect mix of sweetness and depth, with unforgettable characters and stories. I deeply respect him for his talent and creativity as a cartoon maker—his impact on animation is undeniable.</dd>
