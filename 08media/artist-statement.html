        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>One of my most personal and emotional pieces was created out of a deeply traumatic experience. At the center is a girl in a prison suit, symbolizing how I was judged and perceived by others. She’s in shackles, a representation of the overwhelming betrayal I felt. Behind her, a fire consumes what used to be her home, a visual metaphor for loss and destruction. The narrative in the piece leaves no one else to blame but her, capturing the weight of guilt and responsibility that came after a confession. This artwork is a raw expression of that moment, translating pain into a visual story.</p>
        
        <h2>Generational</h2>
        <p>I created a poster that captures my identity and the influences that have shaped me into someone who deeply cares about social and political issues. The top row features a drawing of myself holding a megaphone, declaring my passion and willingness to speak out. Behind me are representations of Mexico City and Utah, two places that have profoundly influenced my beliefs. Below that is a row of my friends, who have been instrumental in shaping my sense of morality and empathy. The bottom row showcases punk artists I grew up listening to, whose bold discussions of controversial topics inspired me at a young age. Together, these elements represent the people, places, and ideas that have guided me to become who I am today.</p>
        
        <h2>Ive Been Shot</h2>
        <p>I created an art piece as a way to process a heartbreaking experience, channeling my emotions into something visual. The piece was built with a marker base and enhanced with colored pencil details. It portrays a jester in a desert-like environment during sunset, inspired by the song "I've Been Shot" by Fletcher Shears. The jester, a representation of myself, sits alone, pondering after receiving a scroll carried by a bird that can be seen flying away in the distance. An arrow pierces the jester’s leg, left untreated, symbolizing my inability to let go of what happened. The lingering arrow represents the last connection I have to someone I’ve lost, making it both painful and precious. This artwork became a powerful outlet for me to confront and explore my emotions.</p>
